This is an application created to follow up with a Flutter course.

[Codemagic static page](https://sf-iampoorflutter.codemagic.app)

It displays a simple app with a single scaffold view, an app bar with a title and a centered image. It's just like the [I Am Rich Flutter App](https://github.com/starfoxcom/I-Am-Rich-Flutter), but without using any help or reference from the course like it was done with the previous mentioned. Everything done here was from scratch, without any help or reference to the course videos or docs... just a simple challenge to prove that i learned how to create a Flutter app from scratch.
